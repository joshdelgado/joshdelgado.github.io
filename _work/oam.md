Here I write a bunch of stuff about how this was built and a bit on the tools I used. I explain that it no longer looks like this but this was still a good project to work on and I utilized new tools I hadn't before.

- Designed in Figma
- Angular 11 used
- Embeded in a JSP application for seamless transition between Dashboard
- Data-driven Java back-end
- Responsive
- Utilizes known libraries such as Material
- Utilizes custom libraries developed in house (by me)
- Nested \<app-router>
- Dynamic text

### Project Summary
- Old site was written in Java and JSP
- A lot of legacy and spaghetti code
- Developers didn't want to work on it and working on it was slow
- Users had trouble finding what they needed on the old dashboard-based site
- Users skewed older and less tech-savvy
- Goal: clean up design, utilize a cleaner and more scalable framework (Angular), make the UX easier for users
### Results
### Problem Actualization (problem to be solved)
### The Product
- Video of the Guided Flow
- An Angular application that guided the user through common paths
- Nested inside a JSP/ Java application for a smooth, gradual transition
- The test case for converting the entire website to an Angular application
### The Process (workflow and technologies)
- Angular 11, Java, Figma
- Weekly stand up meetings
- Breaking up our internal Angular library to only include what is needed or applicable
- Angular Material Forms, Icons
### Conclusion
- A lot of heavy lifitng was done for future projects. Creating multiple internal angular libraries
- A guided flow helps new users understand what can be done and feel more secure
- More documentation is needed (in progress)
