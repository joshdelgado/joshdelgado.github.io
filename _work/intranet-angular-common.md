Here I write a bunch of stuff about how this was built and a bit on the tools I used. I explain that it no longer looks like this but this was still a good project to work on and I utilized new tools I hadn't before.

- Consolidate Styles
- Define essential components
- Defined a consistent UI
- Aligned UI library with codebase
