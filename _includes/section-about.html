				<p class="section__text">I learned basic HTML / CSS when I discovered Myspace in 8th grade. Nearly 7
					years later, I stumbled into a college web design class and have been coding since. After
					college, I developed websites for advertising agencies and small businesses. Sadly, I waited
					too long to hire help for my growing business and I developed an RSI in both of my wrists leaving me
					out of comission for over a year.</p>
				<p class="section__text">After that year of rehab and forced reflection, I got a job with a large
					corporation where I've been working for the past 4 years building internal and client-facing
					applications.</p>
				<p class="section__text">I always look to learn new things, but these are my focuses:</p>
