		<div class="section__about-body">
			<p class="section__text">I learned basic HTML / CSS when I discovered Myspace in the 7th grade. Nearly 7
				years later, I stumbled into a college web design class and have been coding since. After
				college, I developed freelance websites for advertising agencies and small businesses. Sadly, I
				waited
				too long to hire help for my growing business and I developed an RSI in both of my wrists leaving me
				out of comission for over a year.</p>
			<p class="section__text">After many months of rehab and forced reflection, I got a job with a large
				corporation where I've been working for the past 4 years building internal and client-facing
				applications.</p>
			<p class="section__text">I love to learn new things, but these are my focuses:</p>
